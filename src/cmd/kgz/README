kgz

kgz is like gzip, but supports compressing and decompressing to a different
directory than the source file is in.

Usage: kgz [-l] source [target]

If target is a directory, the basename of the sourcefile will be used
as the target filename. Compression and decompression is selected
based on whether the source filename ends in ".gz".

Flags:
	-l level	Compression level (0-9). Only meaninful when
			compressing a file.
