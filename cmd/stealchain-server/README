stealchain-server

This is a utility to extract the verified X.509 chain from a TLS
connection initiated by another client. It listens on a port, and
for each connection, it will dump the certificates that the peer
actually sent (and not the verified chain that is built from this).

It was written to assist in debugging issues with certificate chains.

There are a few knobs:

-listen specifies the address to listen on.

-ca allows the trusted CA roots to be specified via a PEM bundle of
root certificates.

-verify requires that the client present a valid certificate chain.
